## A clerical error in our paper

I am very sorry about this clerical error. 
Actually, in Section 4.6, this part "With the nest connection, the decoder is able to preserve more image information conveyed by the multiscale deep features (𝑀𝐼, 𝐹 𝐹𝑀𝐼𝑑𝑐𝑡, 𝐹 𝐹𝑀𝐼𝑤) and generate more natural and clearer fused image (𝐸𝑁, 𝑆𝐷, 𝑉 𝐼𝐹)." should change to "With the nest connection, the decoder is able to preserve more image information conveyed by the multiscale deep features (𝑀𝐼, Nabf, MS-SSIM) and generate more natural and clearer fused image (𝐸𝑁, 𝑆𝐷, SCD)."
